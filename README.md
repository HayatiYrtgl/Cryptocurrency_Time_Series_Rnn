This code is a Python script for building and training a Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using Keras to predict cryptocurrency prices. Here's a breakdown of what each section does:

1. **Importing Libraries**: This section imports necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, keras, and matplotlib.

2. **Reading Data**: Reads cryptocurrency price data from a CSV file.

3. **Data Exploration**:
   - Checks for missing values.
   - Displays data types and descriptive statistics.
   - Visualizes data using scatter plots and a heatmap of correlations between features.

4. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Converts the timestamp column to datetime format.
   - Sets the timestamp column as the index.

5. **Train-Test Split**:
   - Manually splits the data into training and testing sets.
   - Defines a function `train_test_split` to create input-output pairs for training the model.

6. **Creating the RNN Model**:
   - Uses Keras Sequential API to define an RNN model.
   - The model consists of an Input layer, a SimpleRNN layer with 60 units and 'tanh' activation function, and a Dense output layer.
   - Compiles the model using mean squared error loss and Adam optimizer, with R2Score as a metric.

7. **Training the Model**:
   - Fits the model to the training data with early stopping and model checkpointing callbacks.
   - Validates the model on a validation split of the training data.

8. **Evaluation**:
   - Predicts cryptocurrency prices using the trained model.
   - Plots the predicted prices against the true prices for evaluation.

Overall, this script demonstrates a basic workflow for building and training a recurrent neural network for cryptocurrency price prediction using historical data.
